Arcadia is requesting $2,519.40 for the purpose of implementing the address book in it's entirety as it exists in the QT wallet onto the Zcoin Rich Client. This is an essential functionality for the rich client if it intends to be comparitive with the QT wallet for daily use. This functionality is also a prerequisite functionality for any later iteration ontop of it for a BIP47 integration on the Rich Client.
