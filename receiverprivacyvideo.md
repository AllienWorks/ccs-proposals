Zcoin is set to be the first coin that implements BIP47 Payment Codes in our default wallet or as we call it Receiver Address Privacy.
This allows users to share a single public address without sacrificing privacy and works similarly to Stealth Addresses.
RAP has several advantages in that it can be supported in light wallets and payments to it unlike to Stealth Addresses are indistinguishable from normal payments.
This proposal is to fund a video animation similar to what we have on our Youtube page and the cost of this is roughly 1000 USD which covers voice acting and animation.
Estimated time of completion is about 1-2 months.
