This proposal is for the integration of Zcoin Mnemonics generation and recovery into the rich client wallet. This covers the following objects: 
* My Mnemonic Recovery Phrase, revealed during initial installation (with 'confirm your recovery phrase' functionality)
* Show My Recovery Phrase button, somewhere in the app
* Re-enter Your Passphrase form, in order to be able to reveal the seed phrase
* My Mnemonic Recovery Phrase screen in-app 

The team for this project is:
* 1 Developer
* 1 UI/UX Designer
* 1 Project Manager

Timeframe:
This project is expected to be completed in 2 weeks, but should account for time frame after completion to get merged into master.
